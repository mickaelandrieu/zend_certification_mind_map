This project is a MindMap of the Zend PHP5 Certification STUDY GUIDE by php|Architect's

I'm doing it in order to help me in my exam preparation.
I don't say that if you know this you will have your exam, I'm just putting it here
so that it may help somebody else in its exam prep.

To understand what it's in the mindmap, you may want to buy the book :

And to open the mindmap you may need FreeMind mindmap creator :

May the force be with you all.
