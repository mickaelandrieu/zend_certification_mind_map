This project is a MindMap of the Zend PHP5 Certification STUDY GUIDE by php|Architect's

I'm doing it in order to help me in my exam preparation.
I don't say that if you know this you will have your exam, I'm just putting it here
so that it may help somebody else in its exam prep.

To understand what it's in the mindmap, you may want to buy the book : 
http://www.phparch.com/books/phparchitects-zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-2nd-edition/

And to open the mindmap you may need FreeMind mindmap creator :

(At this day sourceforge official website is down :| will check later if it comes back)

May the force be with you all.

About the Oriented Object Programming in PHP chapter :
I very well know most of its content so I'm only putting what's might have skipped from my mind.
Once again you really have to buy the book...

About the code dir :
I may had code that from the book. I do it only if I think that I need to write it down and make it works to
have a better understanding on what's going on.
