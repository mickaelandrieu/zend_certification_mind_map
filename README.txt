This project is MindMap of the Zend PHP5 Certification STUDY GUIDE by php|Architect's

I'm doing in order to help me in my exam preparation.
I don't say that if you know this you will have your exam, I'm just putting it here
so that it may help somebody else in it's exam prep.

To understand what it's in the mindmap, you may want to buy the book :

May the force be with you all.
